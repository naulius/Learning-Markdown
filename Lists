There are to types of Lists in Markdown, one list in ordered with numbers and the oder one unordered which starts with bullet points.
Unordered list with bullet points starts the with an asterisk and you can see it in Markdown with bullet points.
Example:
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

A list in order you prefaced the list with a number and point.I'ts going to look the same in Markdown.
Example:
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

It's possible to add Italics, Bold and links to a list.
EXample:
* Azalea (_Ericaceae Rhododendron_)
* Chrysanthemum (_Anthemideae Chrysanthemum_)
* Dahlia (_Coreopsideae Dahlia_)

You can have a sub-list in your list, you have to indent your sub-list, also you prefaced with an asterik as your list.
Example:
* Calculus professor
 * Has no hair
 * Often wears green
* Castafiore
 * An opera singer
 * Has white hair
 * is possibly mentally unwell
 
 You can also have paragraph under your list, you have to indent it and if you want leave one space.
 Example:
 1. Cut the cheese

   Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

 2. Slice the tomatoes
  
   Be careful when holding the knife.
