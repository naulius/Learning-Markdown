You can also make a link to an image. The first option is to create a inline image link. Start with an exclamation point, the write a text beteween brackets 
and write the link.
EXample:
![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

An other way to link images is to use reference image.Like in reference link, you need to associate the text to a link. Then, the word is going to be underlined
it means that is related to a link.
Example:

[Orange][]
[Black]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/81_INF_DIV_SSI.jpg
