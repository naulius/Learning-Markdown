To make a phrase Italic in Markdown, I have to surround words with underscored.
Example:
Writing in _Markdown_ is not that hard!

To bold phrases in Markdown, I to surround words with asteriks.
Example:
I **will** complete these lessons!

You can also mix Italic words and Bold words in the same phrase.
Example:
"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a **little moxie**!"

To make words in Italic and Bold, you can add at the beginning and the end two asteriks and one underscored.
Example:
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.
